# The Robot Car

In this hackathon we're using the [PiCar-X](https://www.sunfounder.com/products/picar-x) robot car.

## Computer

The car is controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4b 8GB.
It runs Raspbian - a specialized ARM version of Debian for Raspberry Pi.

## Sensors

- Camera
- Ultrasonic sensor (forward-facing)
- Three grayscale sensors (downward-facing in the front)

## Actuators

- Two back wheel servos
- One front wheel steering servo
- Two camera mount servos (yaw & pitch)
- Speakers

## Batteries

The car is powered by two 18650 batteries.
**Important:
Do not take out the batteries yourself!
When you need new batteries, ask one of the organizers to insert new ones for you.**

## Rules

You are mostly free to do whatever you want but we want you to follow these simple rules:

- You can not disassemble the car
- You can not add additional electronic hardware to the car
- You can use all software resources and internet services you would like
- You can use any additional props you want
- You can use any external computing resources you would like (your laptop, cloud, etc â€¦)

# Getting started

## Connecting to the car

### SSH

The primary way of communicating with the car is through SSH.
Simply turn on the car within reach of the hackathon WiFi and it will read out loud its address, username, and password.
The username is always pi.
You can connect through classical ssh via terminal.
We recommend using [Visual studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension.
Then you can get the normal comfort of a development environment (file tree, terminal, code editor, etc.).

### VNC - Remode Desktop

It is also possible to connect to the car with Remote Desktop.
In this mode, the graphical user interface from the Raspberry Pi will be forwarded to your computer which makes it possible to use graphical programs and easily test the camera.
The car has already been set up with the VNC so you just need to connect to it with the instructions [here](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-x/en/latest/remote_desktop.html?highlight=desktop#vnc) (follow the guide under _Login to VNC_).

## Programming the car

The easiest way to program the car is through Python (feel free to do something else but without resources from us).
All cars have a script named `test.py` in the home folder (`/home/pi`) that you can run that will test all sensors and actuators.
Run `python3 test.py` to test it out.
Watch out (!) though - the car will start driving.
So make sure to clear a meter or two in front of it or simply hold it in your hands.
